## 🧾 Professional LinkedIn Post

I’m excited to share that I’ve completed the AI Programming with Python and TensorFlow Nanodegree from Udacity (July 2025).

Throughout this journey, I strengthened my programming foundations, improved my problem-solving mindset, and gained hands-on experience working with Python, TensorFlow, and real-world project workflows.

As a Computer Systems Engineering student with a strong interest in Java development and software engineering, this experience helped me think more analytically and write more structured, maintainable code.

I’m currently seeking opportunities as a Junior Java Developer or Software Engineer, where I can apply my skills, learn from experienced teams, and contribute to impactful projects.
